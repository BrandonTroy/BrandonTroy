I'm Brandon, a NC State Computer Science student from Apex, NC. I'm interested in anything within the field, and enjoy programming personal projects in my free time.
I'm farily new to GitHub, so I am currently in the process of cleaning up a bunch of old projects and porting them from my pc to here.
