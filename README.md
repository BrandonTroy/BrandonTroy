I'm Brandon, a NC State Computer Science student from Apex, NC. I'm interested in anything within the field, and enjoy programming personal projects in my free time.
I'm currently in the process of cleaning up a bunch of old projects and uploading them from other sources.
Feel free to reach out with inquiries for collaboration of work opportunities.
You can reach me at my email: brandon.troy@gmail.com, or my LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/brandontroy/
